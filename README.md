# Dynamic-Age-Calculator
A lightweight JavaScript application that calculates age in years, months, and days based on user input, featuring colorful and responsive styling.


To create an age calculator using JavaScript, you can use the Date object to calculate the difference between the current date and a user's birthdate, 
determining their age in years, months, and days. This project involves building an HTML form to collect the user's birthdate input, which will then be 
processed using JavaScript to calculate their age. The application will dynamically respond to user input and visually display the calculated age.
